# CNN_Sentiment_Analysis
Photos acquired from Google and downloading all pictures via Google chrome extension (Download All Images)

Searched each emotion as follows:
happy people
sad people 
angry people
confused people
scared people

Built the dataset by utilizing Tensorflow tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory to manually split the data into images and labels

Training resulted in 100% on the validation set, then testing showed 100% accuracy on the test set

Due to the amount of data, I have uploaded a preview of the images used in "angry" and "confused" but a similar tactic was used for all provided emotions
